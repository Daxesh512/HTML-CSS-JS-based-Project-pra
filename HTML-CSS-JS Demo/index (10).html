	 <h1> HISTORY PHOTOGRAPHY</H1>
	 <hr>
	
	 <p><b>Photography</b> is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_black">click here</a> to know more about photography </p>

	<p> Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.</p>
	
	<p>These scientist-magicians<br> the first color photographers, are hardly alone in pushing the boundaries of one of the world’s newest art forms. The history of photography has always been a history of people – artists and inventors who steered the field into the modern era.</p>

	 <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Camera. If you buy a dedicated camera (rather than a phone), pick one with interchangeable lenses so that you can try out different types of photography more easily. Read reviews, but don’t obsess over them, because everything available today is pretty much equally good as its competition. Find a nice deal and move on.</h1>
	 
     <p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lenses. This is where it counts. For everyday photography, start with a standard zoom lens like a 24-70mm or 18-55mm. For portrait photography, pick a prime lens (one that doesn’t zoom) at 35mm, 50mm, or 85mm</p

     <p>HTML allows moving images:</p>

     <center><img src="img/animation.gif" alt="photo gif" style="width:90px;height:100px;"></center>
	 <h4>Background Image</h4>
	
     <p>A background image for a div element:</p>

     <p style="background-image: url('img/A4.jpg');">
	  <style>
	 div {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>
	 
	A wallpaper or background (also known as a desktop wallpaper, desktop background, desktop picture or desktop image on computers) is a digital image (photo, drawing etc.) used as a decorative background of a graphical user interface on the screen of a computer, smartphone or other electronic device. </div>
	 

</style>
	  all you need is a camera, which can be anything from a basic smartphone to an advanced DSLR or a mirrorless camera. However, photography equipment is not all that important – light, subject, emotion and composition are all critical elements of a successful photograph.</p>

  <h2>PHOTOGRAPHY BLOCK</h2>
  <P> Photographer's block is a time when one struggles to produce the kind of work one wants to. One struggles to find the beauty in his/her own work, feels unappreciative of their own work. It's when the weight of the subject kills you inside and you want to break free from all restrictions.</P>
